# PrivateSchool-Javascript
 Manage private school with javascript

This is an Individual Project Assignment for the AFDEmp Coding Bootcamp by Kostopoulou Eirini.

This project uses only Front End, without any databse. The data is temporarily stored in the browser and reset after refresh. It is just intended to showcase how javascript-jquery can implement basic structure and functionality for a private school in a SPA. Precisely, the program can
-store students, trainers, courses and assignments with their details in the browser
-list all the stored entries
-create new entries and edit the existing ones
